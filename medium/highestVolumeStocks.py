Implement a data structure StockMarket which has the following methods:

    StockMarket(String[] stocks, int[] amounts) which creates a new instance.
    stocks and amounts has the same length and each stock stocks[i] initially
    has amounts[i] volume in the market

    add(String stock, int amount) which cumulatively adds stock with volume amount

    top(int k) which returns the top k the highest volume stocks, sorted in descending
    order by volume. If there are ties in volume, return lexicographically the smallest
    stocks first.

Constraints
n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the number of calls to add and top.
