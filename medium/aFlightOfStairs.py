"""

There's a staircase with n steps, and you can climb up either 1 or 2 steps at a time.

Given an integer n, write a function that returns the number of unique ways you can
climb the staircase. The order of the steps matters, so each different order of steps
counts as a way.

Mod the result by 10 ** 9 + 7.
