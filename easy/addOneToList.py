"""

You are given a list of integers nums, representing a decimal number and nums[i] is between [0, 9].
For example, [1, 3, 9] represents the number 139.

Return the same list in the same representation except modified so that 1 is added to the number.

Constraints
1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the length of nums.
