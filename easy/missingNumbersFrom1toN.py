"""

You are given a list of integers nums of length n where all numbers in the list are from the interval
[1,n] and some elements appear twice while others only once.
Return all the numbers from [1,n] that are not in the list, sorted in ascending order.

Can you do it in O(n) time, modify nums in-place and use O(1) additional space?

Constraints
n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the length of nums
