"""

You are given a list of integers nums of length n representing the
current score of swimmers in a competition. There is one more round
to swim and the first place winner for this round gets n points, second
place n-1 points, etc. and the last place gets 1 point.

Return the number of swimmers that can still win the competition
after the last round. If you tie for first in points, this still counts as winning.

Constraints
n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the length of nums
